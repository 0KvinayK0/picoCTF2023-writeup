# useless

## Challenge

### Description

There's an interesting script in the user's home directory

The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag.

```
Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net
Port:     52699
Username: picoplayer
```

### Hints

(None)

## Solution

The script tells us to read the manual, so we use `man useless` and found the flag.

## Flag

picoCTF{us3l3ss_ch4ll3ng3_3xpl0it3d_7065}
